This will ensure that:\n    - You have compatible versions of all relevant packages provided in the environment;\n    - You have a GitHub repository that you can use to share your code.\n- Submit assignments by 9:00pm Eastern Time on the due date on [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com).\n- Every student should submit their own PDF representing their own understanding of the material. If you worked with others, make sure to credit them.\n- More detailed [homework instructions and logistics](../policies/homework.qmd#homework-logistics) are available.\n- Submissions must be PDFs. Make sure that you tag the pages corresponding to each question; points will be deducted otherwise.\n- To convert the assignment notebook to PDF, you can use VS Code to render the notebook to HTML, and then use your browser to print to PDF. If you have set up LaTeX with VS Code, you can convert directly to a PDF. \n- As an alternative, when you commit and push a `.ipynb` file (a Jupyter Notebook) to your repository, we have set up a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to automatically render your notebook to a PDF, which you can then download and submit to Gradescope. However, sometimes GitHub actions can take a while or can stall out, so you'll need to monitor this and give yourself some time. If you've waited a while and your notebook isn't rendering, reach out on Ed and we can figure out what's going on. In the worst case (you push your changes close to the deadline), the timestamp of your commit will be evidence that you completed the assignment on time, even if we can't render the PDF until the next day.\n\n## Grading\n\nMake sure to look over the [standard homework rubric](../policies/rubric.qmd) and familiarize yourself with the [homework](../policies/homework.qmd) and [grading policies](../policies/grading.qmd).\n\n\n## Schedule\n\n| Assignment | Topic | Instructions | Solutions | Assigned | Due| \n|:------:|:------------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|\n| HW 1 | Intro and Exploratory Data Analysis | [{{< fa sharp pen-field >}}](hw01/hw01.qmd) |  [{{< fa sharp key-skeleton >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"} | Jan. 21, 2026 | Feb. 06, 2026 |\n| HW 2 | Linear Models and DAGs | [{{< fa sharp pen-field >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"}  [{{< fa sharp key-skeleton >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"} | Feb. 09, 2026 | Feb. 20, 2026 |\n| HW 3 | Generalized Linear Models and Time Series | [{{< fa sharp pen-field >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"}  [{{< fa sharp key-skeleton >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"} | Feb. 23, 2026 | Mar. 06, 2026 |\n| HW 4 | Monte Carlo | [{{< fa sharp pen-field >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"}  [{{< fa sharp key-skeleton >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"} | Mar. 16, 2026 | Mar. 27, 2026 |\n| HW 5 | The Bootstrap and Multiple Imputation | [{{< fa sharp pen-field >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"}  [{{< fa sharp key-skeleton >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"} | Apr. 06, 2026 | Apr. 17, 2026 |\n| HW 6 | Model Scoring and Hypothesis Testing | [{{< fa sharp pen-field >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"}  [{{< fa sharp key-skeleton >}}]{style=\"color: grey;\"} | Apr. 20, 2026 | May. 20, 2026 |\n\n",
