# Why Analyze Data?

## Why Does Data Analysis Matter?

- Scientific insight;
- Decision-making;
- Understanding uncertainty

## Examples of Data-Related Questions

- How often will a particular (usually extreme) outcome occur?
- What causes differences between environmental conditions at different times/locations?
- What might the impacts be of environmental change?
- Does a new (treatment/management) method have a reliable impact?

## The Ideal

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
**Goal**: Obtain data that is so self-evident that you don't need to do statistics!
:::
::: {.column width=50%}

## But in Actuality

- Except in the most controlled experiments, **data are noisy**;
- The **causes** of the data cannot be extracted from the data alone;
- The **reasons** for statistical analyses are not found in the data themselves.

## Causation Is Not Association

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- We've all heard "correlation (**association**) does not imply causation"
- But confounds/noise can mean **causation does not imply association**

## Description and Inference are Connected
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Except for superficial tasks: 

- Knowing what is important to describe requires a model;
- Understanding how the data might differ from the population requires a model.

## Some Problems With The "Standard" Data Analysis Toolkit

::: {.incremental}
- Statistical assumptions may not be valid;
- "Null" vs "Alternative" hypotheses and tests may be chosen for computational convenience, not scientific relevance.
- Many different **substantive** models can imply the same **statistical** model.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Important**: "Big" data doesn't solve the problem!
:::


## Model-Based Data Analysis

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
Models are how we assess evidence for theories.

Models are encodings of hypothesized **data-generating processes**.

## What Can We Do With Models?

- **Inference**: what are parameter values which explain data?
- **Simulation**: what are alternative counterfactual observations?
- **Projection**: what future data might be observed assuming this data-generating process?
- **Testing**: which data-generating processes are most consistent with the data?
