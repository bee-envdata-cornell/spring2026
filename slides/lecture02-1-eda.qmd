# Review

## Probability Fundamentals

- Bayesian vs. Frequentist Interpretations
- Distributions reflect assumptions on probability of data.
- Normal distributions: "least informative" distribution for a given mean/variance.
- Fit distributions by maximizing likelihood.
- Communicating uncertainty: confidence vs. predictive intervals.


# Exploratory Data Analysis


## You Can Always Fit Models...

## Some Implications of Mis-Specification

- Biased estimates (expected value from the model does not match "true" expected value);
- Incorrect inferences or inappropriate understandings of relationships/causality.
- Over/under-confident risk assessments.

Goal is to start with some "true" process, then apply a procedure (experimental/observational + statistical) and recover what is hopefully a good estimate.

But lots can go wrong in this process!

## How Do We Choose What To Model?

## How Do We Choose What To Model?

Developing suitable models often starts with both **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **theoretical reasoning**.

::: {.incremental}
1. **EDA**: examining patterns/relationships with visual (plots, clustering) or quantitative (correlations).
2. **Theory**: Avoids "data dredging" or "mining," which can find spurious correlations or patterns which are misleading without broader context about data-generating mechanisms.
:::


## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Will see many examples of this throughout the semester.
- Try to impose as few assumptions as possible.
- Goal of exploratory analysis is to **get a high-level view of the data** and **formulate hypotheses/check if data is fit for purpose**.

## EDA Questions

EDA is about generating questions and identifying if the data quality is sufficient to address them.

Common questions to guide EDA:

1. **What type of variability occurs within my variables?**
2. **What type of covariation occurs between my variables?**

## Common EDA Questions

- What is the range of the data? What are "typical" values?
- What values are rare? Do they make sense?
- Are there missing data or strange outliers? What might explain them?
- Is a particular relationship or distribution supported by the data?


## Common EDA Approaches

- Data summaries (quantiles, mean/median, max/min, etc.)
- Correlations
- **Plot data** (from multiple perspectives)
- Clustering (do you need multiple models?)

## Example: NY Air Quality Dataset

```{julia}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| output: true

aq = DataFrame(CSV.File("data/airquality/airquality.csv"))
rename!(aq, :"Solar.R" => :Solar) # rename solar radiation column to get rid of period
aq[1:5, :]
```

## Quantitative EDA: Summaries

```{julia}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| output: true

aq_stack = stack(aq, 2:5)
aq_gp = @groupby(aq_stack, :variable)
@combine(aq_gp, $AsTable = (
        min=minimum(skipmissing(:value)), 
        median=median(skipmissing(:value)),
        mean=mean(skipmissing(:value)),
        max=maximum(skipmissing(:value)),
        missings=sum(ismissing.(:value))
    )
)

```

## Quantitative EDA: Correlations

```{julia}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| output: true

aq_cor = cor(Matrix(dropmissing(aq[:, 2:5])))
DataFrame(aq_cor, names(aq[:, 2:5]))
```

# Visual EDA

Four datasets, all with the same means, variances, correlations, and regression lines.

Shows the importance of visualization!

## Visualizations for EDA

- Often useful to start with **scatterplots**: one variable (typically independent) on the $x$-axis, another (typically dependent) on the $y$-axis.
- Time series: **time always goes on the $x$-axis**.
- Boxplots for comparison quantiles/ranges of variables or groups of data.

## Boxplots vs Histograms

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
**Boxplots**: Show quantiles (usually median + 1.5 $\times IQR)

**Histogram**: See distribution of data.
:::
::: {.column width=50%}
```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-explore1
#| fig-cap: Paired plots of air quality dataset

p1 = boxplot(skipmissing(aq[!, :Ozone]), ylabel="Ozone (ppb)")

p2 = histogram(skipmissing(aq[!, :Ozone]), ylabel="Ozone (ppb)")

p = plot(p1, p2, layout=(2, 1), size=(1100, 400))

```
:::
::::

## Scatterplots

```{julia}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-explore2
#| fig-cap: Paired plots of air quality dataset

# this uses the dataframe plotting syntax from StatsPlots.jl
p1 = @df aq scatter(:Ozone, :Solar, markersize=5, color=:blue, xlabel="Ozone (ppb)", ylabel="Solar Radiation (lang)", leftmargin=10mm)
p2 = @df aq scatter(:Ozone, :Wind, markersize=5, color=:blue, xlabel="Ozone (ppb)", ylabel="Wind Speed (mph)", leftmargin=10mm)
p3 = @df aq scatter(:Ozone, :Temp, markersize=5, color=:blue, xlabel="Ozone (ppb)", ylabel="Max Temperature (°F) ", leftmargin=10mm)

p = plot(p1, p2, p3, layout=(1, 3), size=(1100, 400))

```


# Key Points


## EDA

- **EDA**: Understand structure of data while making as few assumptions as possible (e.g. look at the raw data, not "smoothed" versions).
- Need to be willing to ask many questions of your data: most won't make sense once you look at the data.
- You might be asking the "right" questions but have the "wrong" data: be open-minded and rely on domain knowledge.
- Quantitative EDA can be a starting point, but EDA also requires visualization.


# Upcoming Schedule

## Next Classes

**Wednesday**: Data Visualization

**Friday**: Data Visualization Discussion

## To Be Prepared for Friday

1. Find a visualization and its underlying dataset you find interesting (article, web repository, news story).
2. Critique the visualization: What story is it trying to tell? What does it do well? What's confusing or limited about it?
3. Try reconstructing it to tell the story "better".
4. Come to class with the original visual and your attempt at improving it.


## Assessments

**Homework 1** Due Friday, 2/6.
