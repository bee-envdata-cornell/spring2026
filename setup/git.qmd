## Installing git

If you have already installed `git`, you don't need to worry about this section. If you haven't, [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) the appropriate version for your operating system.

## Create GitHub Account

## Setting Up GitHub Account

::: {.callout-note}
If you already have a GitHub account, you can use that for this course and do not need to create a new account.
:::

Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). It doesn't have to be linked to your Cornell email or use your Cornell NetID.

For labs and homework assignments (we will work on Lab 1 in class and Homework 1 is available), you should use the GitHub Classroom link to "accept" the assignment provided on Ed Discussion, which will give you your own GitHub repository for that assignment. The first time you click one of these links, you will need to link your place on the course roster with your GitHub account. After this, you will not need to do so again.
